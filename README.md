I'm a software engineer who started with QBasic around 1995 and started working
professionally with PHP in 2000. My career has centered around building web
applications, web services, and command-line tools. I find immense satisfaction
in automating solutions, helping people save time and effort, writing tests,
publishing documentation, and creating reliable, intuitive systems.

## *Senior DevOps Engineer*, IBM Quantum (2019 &mdash; present)

As part of [IBM Quantum](https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/), I was
responsible for the entire lifecycle of backend infrastructure running both
production and research & development workloads.

I led the deployment automation effort for all backend Linux systems, which was
previously done manually from docs with handful of bash snippets to a
variety of different hardware configurations, operating systems, and platforms.
After I converted all available documentation to Ansible playbooks, which I
tested in Vagrant & VirtualBox, I helped standardize hardware and operating
system configuration by automating the provisioning process from baremetal. I
later introduced Concourse CI to provide a continuous integration and
continuous deployment platform, meeting business needs across multiple
geographically-distributed private networks while delivering changes across all
production devices multiple times per day without human intervention.

I led the modernization of monitoring and alerting from backend infrastructure
from local log files to centralized logging via LogDNA, system monitoring via
Sysdig (which is built on Prometheus and `statsd`), and alerting via PagerDuty.

I also led the full operations lifecycle of geographically distributed Red Hat
OpenShift/Kubernetes clusters from baremetal and virtualized provisioning to
running clusters as part of [IBM Cloud
Satellite](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/satellite), primarily for neartime quantum
compute workloads.

- *Squad Lead*: As squad lead, I ran daily standups, weekly backlog grooming,
  biweekly retrospectives, and biweekly sprint planning for a team responsible
  for backend infrastructure and Quantum control systems software. I also
  worked to help other teams adopt agile practices.

- *Security Owner*: As security owner for almost all baremetal Linux systems in
  IBM Quantum, I leveraged our continuous deployment capabilities to rapidly
  improve our security posture, mitigate and resolve vulnerabilities, and
  manage authorization for internal users.

## *Senior Developer Advocate*, IBM Developer (2017 &mdash; 2019)

As part of [IBM Developer](https://developer.ibm.com/), I worked on a team
responsible for creating and managing developer advocacy content such as
tutorials, articles, and code patterns covering topics such as IBM Watson and
IBM Cloud. A code pattern is an open source example demonstrating how
developers can leverage specific IBM services in their projects and are
presented by developer advocates in labs, workshops, and presentations.

Several of my accomplishments with IBM Developer focus on allowing a small team
of developer advocates to build, deliver, and maintain thousands of pieces of
technical content spread across hundreds of git repositories in a scalable
manner. For example:

- automatically identifying and updating broken and outdated links,
- building a tool to interactively validate Markdown frontmatter in YAML (using
  JSON Schema),
- automating the conversion of a legacy documentation format (XML to Markdown),
- updating branding of IBM products and services, and
- writing Selenium tests to exercise previously-untested workflows in the IBM
  Cloud console.

> Dolph has gone out of his way to help the editorial team with several special
  projects. His help has been invaluable and has saved our team hours of work.
  He's streamlined and updated processes to make tools easier to use and to
  offload work from us. &mdash; Jill Amaya

I was also entrusted to serve as an administrator of IBM's open source presence
on GitHub, [github.com/IBM](https://github.com/ibm/), managing the creation of
open source projects and the integration with 3rd party services.

## *Principal Software Engineer*, Rackspace (2011-2017)

At [Rackspace](https://www.rackspace.com/), I worked as an open source
[Python](https://www.python.org/) developer, on a globally distributed team, in
the [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) community. After being hired as a
**Software Engineer**, I was promoted to **Principal Engineer** in November
2014.

During that time, I become a core contributor of [OpenStack
Keystone](http://github.com/openstack/keystone), the identity service for
OpenStack-based clouds, and I was subsequently elected by my peers as the
Project Technical Lead (PTL) and a member of the [OpenStack Technical
Committee](https://www.openstack.org/foundation/tech-committee/) (TC). Later, I
helped launch the OpenStack Innovation Center (OSIC), a joint partnership
between [Rackspace](https://www.rackspace.com/) and [Intel](https://01.org/),
as a technical lead and cross-project liaison. I also helped lead the broader
OpenStack technical strategy at Rackspace via the OpenStack Technical
Leadership Team and the Rackspace Private Cloud architecture group.

Reviewing code from other contributors was one of my most satisfying endeavors.
In the early days of OpenStack, I helped kickstart OpenStack's code review
discipline via [Gerrit](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/). Since then, I've
strived to provide other contributors with high-value constructive criticism,
with an eye towards fostering the community of new contributors, core
reviewers, and technical leads both within Rackspace and beyond.

I developed a rigorous appetite for a documentation-first approach (which
pushes developers to think through the user experience before diving into an
implementation), thorough automated testing (particularly important when
working with thousands of fellow technical contributors), and comprehensive
continuous integration (from `git push` to shipping release artifacts).

## *Software Engineer*, Akimeka (2009 &mdash; 2011)

At [Akimeka](http://www.akimeka.com/), I worked on a project for the Department
of Defense (DoD) Defense Healthcare Management System (DHMS) while holding a
Secret security clearance.

## Side projects

I've had many more side projects, but this is a handful I enjoy talking about.

- [find-replace](https://github.com/dolph/find-replace): A fast find & replace
  shell command written in Go.

  Core technology stack: [Go](https://go.dev/)

- [dotfiles](https://github.com/dolph/dotfiles): I've been version controlling
  my desktop configuration files since 2013, across operating systems (OS X,
  Ubuntu Linux, and Fedora Linux), and across multiple desktop environments
  (Gnome, Xfce and i3). I now use Ansible to keep configuration across multiple
  workstations in sync.

  Core technology stack: [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/),
  [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

- [github.com/dolph/recipes](https://github.com/dolph/recipes): I love to cook,
  and I version control my recipe collection.

  Core technology stack: [Github-flavored
  Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

- [git-ready](https://github.com/dolph/git-ready): I found OpenStack's Gerrit
  workflow to be a little cumbersome and (ironically) anti-social, so I built
  to a [Python](https://www.python.org/)-based CLI tool to eliminate that pain
  and promote positive social interactions.

  Core technology stack: [Python
  2](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.0/),
  [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

- [pasteraw](http://github.com/dolph/pasteraw): Frustrated by slow pastebin
  services with poor CLI support, I built a fast, lightweight plaintext
  pastebin service that pushes content directly to a CDN-enabled object store.
  A few members of the OpenStack community adopted it, as well. Pastes are
  still available today via CDN, but the frontend has been shutdown.

  Core technology stack: [Python
  2](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.0/),
  [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/), [OpenStack Swift
  (Object
  Storage)](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/user-guides/infrastructure/cloud-config/storage/cloud-files-product-concepts/object-storage)
  [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

- [poker-hand-evaluator](https://github.com/dolph/poker-hand-evaluator): I
  found that evaluating and comparing poker hands to be an incredibly
  interesting and multifaceted problem. As a fun exercise, I built a no-frills
  command line tool in [Go](https://golang.org/), mostly using bitwise
  operations, to efficiently identify the best 5-card poker hand out from a
  7-card set. The result is a unique integer that represents the strength of
  the hand, allowing the hand to be compared to other 5- and 7-card hands to
  determine a winner.
