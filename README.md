## Rackspace (June 2011 &mdash; present)

At [Rackspace](https://www.rackspace.com/), I worked as an open source [Python](https://www.python.org/) developer in the [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) community. I was rapidly promoted to **Software Engineer V**, and then advanced to **Principal Engineer** in November 2014.

During that time, I become a core contributor of [OpenStack Keystone](http://github.com/openstack/keystone), the identity service for OpenStack-based clouds, and I was subsequently elected by my peers as the Project Technical Lead (PTL) and a member of the [OpenStack Technical Committee](https://www.openstack.org/foundation/tech-committee/) (TC). Later, I helped launch the [OpenStack Innovation Center](https://osic.org/), a joint partnership between [Rackspace](https://www.rackspace.com/) and [Intel](https://01.org/), as a technical lead and cross-project liaison. I also helped lead the broader OpenStack technical strategy at Rackspace via the OpenStack Technical Leadership Team and the Rackspace Private Cloud architecture group.

In the early days of OpenStack, I helped kickstart OpenStack's code review discipline via [Gerrit](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/). Since then, I've strived to provide other contributors with high-value constructive criticism, with an eye towards fostering the community of new contributors, core reviewers, and technical leads both within Rackspace and beyond.

I developed a rigorous appetite for a documentation-first approach (which pushes developers to think through the user experience before diving into an implementation), thorough automated testing (particularly important when working with thousands of fellow technical contributors), and comprehensive continuous integration (from `git push` to shipping release artifacts).

## Akimeka (June 2009 &mdash; May 2011)

## Side projects

- [git-ready](http://dolphm.com/git-ready/): I found OpenStack's Gerrit workflow to be a little cumbersome and (ironically) anti-social, so I built to a [Python](https://www.python.org/)-based CLI tool to eliminate that pain and promote positive social interactions.

- [github.com/dolph/recipes](https://github.com/dolph/recipes): I love to cook, and I version control my recipe collection with [Github-flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) nearly every day.

- [pasteraw](http://pasteraw.com/): Frustrated by slow pastebin services with poor CLI support, I built an incredibly fast, lightweight plaintext pastebin service that pushes content directly to a CDN-enabled object store.

- [@SteamyDeals](https://twitter.com/steamydeals): As a PC gamer, I found it difficult to keep up with [Steam's](http://store.steampowered.com/) frequent sales, deep discounts, and rapidly expanding product catalog, so I built a bot to identify and track highly-rated, popular games, and send notifications only when those products reach their best prices. On the backend, it features a full CI/CD pipeline that deploys a serverless PaaS-based architecture (utilizing application containers, message queues, and a fully-managed SQL service) from just a `git push`.

- [hyperf](https://github.com/dolph/hyperf) (unfinished): Faced with a need for the statistical analytics of [ApacheBench](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html), the need for more flexibility in building HTTP requests, and a desire to generate as much concurrency as possible, I picked up [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and set out to write a modern command line tool for measuring HTTP performance.

- [poker-hand-evaluator](https://github.com/dolph/poker-hand-evaluator): I found that evaluating and comparing poker hands to be an incredibly interesting and multifaceted problem. As a fun exercise, I built a command line tool in [Go](https://golang.org/), mostly using bitwise operations, to identify the best 5-card poker hand out from a 7-card set. The result is a unique integer that represents the strength of the hand, allowing the hand to be compared to other 5- and 7-card hands to determine a winner.

- [Boudros](http://boudros.com/) and [Zinc](http://zincwine.com/): Throughout middle school, high school, and college, I built websites and web applications for various clients as a freelancer, mostly on a LAMP stack. Today, I still maintain two restaurant websites for dad's business, running on [chaussette](https://chaussette.readthedocs.io/), [Python](https://www.python.org/) ([Pylons](http://pylonsproject.org/)) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), all tested and deployed from a CI/CD pipeline using [ConcourseCI](https://concourse.ci/) (based on [Docker containers](https://www.docker.com/)) and [Fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/).
