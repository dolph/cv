# Dolph Mathews

I'm a software developer that started with QBasic around 1995 and started working professionally with PHP in 2000. My career has centered around building web applications, web services, and command-line tools. I find immense satisfaction in automating solutions, helping people save time and effort, writing tests, creating documentation, and building reliable, intuitive systems.

## IBM (2017 &mdash; present)

At [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/), I worked as a **Senior Developer Advocate** on a team responsible for developing and managing developer advocacy content on [IBM Developer](https://developer.ibm.com/) such as tutorials, articles, and code patterns covering topics such as IBM Watson and IBM Cloud. A code pattern is an open source example demonstrating how developers can leverage specific IBM services in their projects and are presented by developer advocates in labs, workshops, and presentations.

Several of my accomplishments with IBM Developer focus on allowing a small team of developer advocates to build, deliver, and maintain thousands of pieces of technical content spread across hundreds of git repositories in a scalable manner. For example:

* automatically identifying and updating broken and outdated links,
* building a tool to interactively validate Markdown frontmatter in YAML (using JSON Schema),
* automating the conversion of a legacy documentation format (XML to Markdown),
* updating branding of IBM products and services, and
* writing Selenium tests to exercise previously-untested workflows in the IBM Cloud console.

> Dolph has gone out of his way to help the editorial team with several special projects. His help has been invaluable and has saved our team hours of work. He's streamlined and updated processes to make tools easier to use and to offload work from us. &mdash; Jill Amaya

I was also entrusted to serve as an administrator of IBM's open source presence on GitHub, [github.com/IBM](https://github.com/ibm/), managing the creation of open source projects and the integration with 3rd party services.

## Rackspace (2011 &mdash; 2017)

At [Rackspace](https://www.rackspace.com/), I worked as an open source [Python](https://www.python.org/) developer, on a globally distributed team, in the [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) community. I was rapidly promoted to **Software Engineer V**, and then advanced to **Principal Engineer** in November 2014.

During that time, I become a core contributor of [OpenStack Keystone](http://github.com/openstack/keystone), the identity service for OpenStack-based clouds, and I was subsequently elected by my peers as the Project Technical Lead (PTL) and a member of the [OpenStack Technical Committee](https://www.openstack.org/foundation/tech-committee/) (TC). Later, I helped launch the [OpenStack Innovation Center](https://osic.org/), a joint partnership between [Rackspace](https://www.rackspace.com/) and [Intel](https://01.org/), as a technical lead and cross-project liaison. I also helped lead the broader OpenStack technical strategy at Rackspace via the OpenStack Technical Leadership Team and the Rackspace Private Cloud architecture group.

Reviewing code from other contributors was one of my most satisfying endeavors. In the early days of OpenStack, I helped kickstart OpenStack's code review discipline via [Gerrit](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/). Since then, I've strived to provide other contributors with high-value constructive criticism, with an eye towards fostering the community of new contributors, core reviewers, and technical leads both within Rackspace and beyond.

I developed a rigorous appetite for a documentation-first approach (which pushes developers to think through the user experience before diving into an implementation), thorough automated testing (particularly important when working with thousands of fellow technical contributors), and comprehensive continuous integration (from `git push` to shipping release artifacts).

## Akimeka (2009 &mdash; 2011)

At [Akimeka](http://www.akimeka.com/), I worked as a software engineer for the Department of Defense (DoD) Defense Healthcare Management System (DHMS) while holding a Secret security clearance.

## Side projects

I've had many more side projects, but this is a handful I enjoy talking about.

- [git-ready](http://dolphm.com/git-ready/): I found OpenStack's Gerrit workflow to be a little cumbersome and (ironically) anti-social, so I built to a [Python](https://www.python.org/)-based CLI tool to eliminate that pain and promote positive social interactions.

- [github.com/dolph/recipes](https://github.com/dolph/recipes): I love to cook, and I version control my recipe collection with [Github-flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

- [pasteraw](http://github.com/dolph/pasteraw): Frustrated by slow pastebin services with poor CLI support, I built a fast, lightweight plaintext pastebin service that pushes content directly to a CDN-enabled object store. A few members of the OpenStack community adopted it, as well. Pastes are still available today via CDN, but the frontend has been shutdown.

- [poker-hand-evaluator](https://github.com/dolph/poker-hand-evaluator): I found that evaluating and comparing poker hands to be an incredibly interesting and multifaceted problem. As a fun exercise, I built a no-frills command line tool in [Go](https://golang.org/), mostly using bitwise operations, to efficiently identify the best 5-card poker hand out from a 7-card set. The result is a unique integer that represents the strength of the hand, allowing the hand to be compared to other 5- and 7-card hands to determine a winner.

- [Boudros](http://boudros.com/) and [Zinc](http://zincwine.com/): Throughout middle school, high school, and college, I built websites and web applications for various clients as a freelancer, mostly on a LAMP stack. Today, I still maintain two restaurant websites for dad's business, running on [chaussette](https://chaussette.readthedocs.io/), [Python](https://www.python.org/) ([Pylons](http://pylonsproject.org/)) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), all tested and deployed from a CI/CD pipeline using [ConcourseCI](https://concourse.ci/) (based on [Docker containers](https://www.docker.com/)) and [Fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/).
